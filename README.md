Kubernetes deployment strategies
================================

> In Kubernetes there is few different way to release an application, you have
to carefully choose the right strategy to make your infrastructure resilient.

- [recreate](recreate/): terminate the old version and release the new one
- [ramped](ramped/): release a new version on a rolling update fashion, one
  after the other
- [blue/green](blue-green/): release a new version alongside the old version
  then switch traffic
- [canary](canary/): release a new version to a subset of users, then proceed
  to a full rollout
- [a/b testing](ab-testing/): release a new version to a subset of users in a
  precise way (HTTP headers, cookie, weight, etc.). This doesnâ€™t come out of the
  box with Kubernetes, it imply extra work to setup a smarter
  loadbalancing system (Istio, Linkerd, Traeffik, custom nginx/haproxy, etc).
- [shadow](shadow/): release a new version alongside the old version. Incoming
  traffic is mirrored to the new version and doesn't impact the
  response.
